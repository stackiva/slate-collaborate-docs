# Why Slate Collaborative?

!! First of all, welcome and thank you for trying out the **Beta for the Slate Collaborative Plugin**. Feel free to use this in your products at this time. The collaborative editing is stable and we haven't found bugs for some time; however, we are planning to add some important features before taking it out of beta.

Slate Collaborate **adds collaborative editing to any Slate editor** in a few lines of code. With it multiple people can view and edit the same document at the same time and see each others changes live.

Google Docs popularized collaborating editing in 2006 nearly 14 years ago. Collaborative editing is table stakes for serious apps in 2020. Users want and expect real-time collaborative editing.

## Why **Slate** as a Collaborative Editor

Developers prefer Slate because of its simple yet powerful nested data model. Because of it, it's easy to support advanced data types like tables and nested quotes and it is flexible enough to support any custom data type you can imagine.

Other open source editors support collaborative editing using a less powerful linear data model. This makes supporting collaborative easier, but complex data types are hard to build with collaborative editing. Practically speaking, you need to build your own collaborative model for the more complex data types that don't fit into a linear model.

The Collaborative Slate Service gives you the best of both worlds: Slate's simple yet extremely powerful and flexible data model that allows you to model anything, and an easy-to-use plug-in collaborative editing service.

## How Slate Collaborative Lets You Build More and Better Editor Features

Currently, there are two ways to support collaborative editing in Slate. The first approach is to build your own collaborative services and editor plugins. This costs you time, money and resources while adding complexity to your development process. After spending a few months or a year building a collaborative editing service you will have cost your company tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then you have to maintain the software and continue to upgrade your collaborative services as Slate continues to improve.

The Slate Collaborative Service does all this heavy lifting for you.

We have spent the necessary time and effort to make collaborative editing work with any Slate data model whether it contains lists, tables or even complex custom styles and components.

Because you are not spending time on making custom Slate collaborative editing software nor are you spending time making custom workarounds to other open source editors with linear data models, you can simply focus on making amazing editors.
